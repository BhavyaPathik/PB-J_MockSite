# PB-J_MockSite
It is a static webpage where I used mostly CSS to make it look as modern as I could with my current understanding, I have used gradient colors, shadows and some new hover effects as well as I have tried to dip my finger in javascript just enought to get one scroll to top button to work, Will try more in future.
It is barely interactive links don't lead to somewhere else, its more for the frontend perspective as of now.
